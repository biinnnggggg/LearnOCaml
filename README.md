# Ninety-Nine OCaml Problems

My solutions for the [99 OCaml problems]https://ocaml.org/problems in OCaml.

These are a series of programming problems inspired by [Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems]https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/problemas-lisp/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html which in turn was based on ["Prolog problem list"]https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/ by Werner Hett.
